Note: In order to use the IPP solver, we need a re-parametrization such that:
      x = 4t - 2, y = 2s -1 where 0 <= s,t <= 1
      and re-formulate the given equations f and g to get coefficients data shown above.

      We also note that a lot of root boxes are generated during solution process
      due to the tangential intersection at (s,t)=(0.5,1) i.e. (x,y)=(2,0).
      Such root boxes are merged and consolidated as "one" root through the 
      root consolidation process.

      Also note you will need to substitute the resulting roots in (s,t) into:
      x = 4t - 2 and y = 2s -1 to have the roots in (x,y) as mentioned above.
